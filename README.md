# Angular-Blog

The Blogig App was generate with using MEAN.
- MongoDB -database system,
- Express-routing- back-end web framework,
- Angular – front-end framework,
- Node.JS – back-end runtime environment.

#About
----------
This web application is for my learning purposes, samples of use cases in angular. The goal of this app is to test the different approaches in [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.6.

# Prerequisites
----------------
Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes Node.js® and an npm package manager.

Node.js
----------
Angular requires Node.js version 10.9.0 or later.
- To check your version, run node -v in a terminal/console window.
- To get Node.js, go to nodejs.org.

NPM package manager
---------------------
Angular, the Angular CLI, and Angular apps depend on features and functionality provided by libraries that are available as npm packages. To download and install npm packages, you must have an npm package manager.

This setup guide uses the npm client command line interface, which is installed with Node.js by default.

To check that you have the npm client installed, run npm -v in a terminal/console window.

Installation of the Angular CLI
--------------------------------
You use the Angular CLI to create projects, generate application and library code, and perform a variety of ongoing development tasks such as testing, bundling, and deployment. Install the Angular CLI globally.

To install the CLI using npm, open a terminal/console window and enter the following command:

npm install -g @angular/cli

Installation of Blog Single Page App
--------------------------------------
Navigate to root folder and install node modules

npm install

# Run

To run the application, run the ng serve command, remember to install nodejs, run the commands npm install npm @ latest, npm install -g @ angular / cli. Then go to `http: // localhost: 4200 /`. The performance can be checked by running the application locally.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
